## Features

- **React Components:** Utilized React's component-based architecture to create reusable UI elements.
- **State Management:** Managed application state using React's built-in state management features.
- **Routing:** Implemented routing using React Router to navigate between different pages.
- **Backend Integration:** Utilized a dummy backend to simulate data fetching and API interactions.
